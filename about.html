      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>A lightweight, front-wheel, direct-pedal-powered tricycle was designed, fabricated, and raced for the 3,400-foot course at the 2025 Acadiana 500 relay. Beginning with a salvaged 1020 steel bicycle frame and fork, the team developed a rigid rear axle assembly using TIG-welded 4130 tubing and a heat-treated 4140 steel axle, supported by brass bushings and sealed ball bearings.</p>
      <p>FEA estimated a max von Mises stress of 75 MPa under an 800 N rider load, yielding a safety factor of 4.5. The tip-over angle of 23° confirmed stability. At 35 lbs and under $120, the trike proved highly competitive, reaching 14–15 mph during testing. The “Fast Pedal Engineers” won 1st place overall in all 5 heats without failures or penalties.</p>
